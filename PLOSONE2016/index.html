			Multilingualism is common offline, but we have a more limited understanding of the ways multilingualism is displayed online and the roles that multilinguals play 
      in the spread of content between speakers of different languages. We take a computational approach to studying multilingualism using one of the largest usergenerated 
      content platforms, Wikipedia. We study multilingualism by collecting and analyzing a large dataset of the content written by multilingual editors of
      the English, German, and Spanish editions of Wikipedia. This dataset contains over two million paragraphs edited by over 15,000 multilingual users from July
      8 to August 9, 2013. We analyze these multilingual editors in terms of their engagement, interests, and language proficiency in their primary and non-primary
      (secondary) languages and find that the English edition of Wikipedia displays different dynamics from the Spanish and German editions. Users primarily
      editing the Spanish and German editions make more complex edits than users who edit these editions as a second language. In contrast, users editing the
      English edition as a second language make edits that are just as complex as the edits by users who primarily edit the English edition. In this way, English
      serves a special role bringing together content written by multilinguals from many language editions. Nonetheless, language remains a formidable hurdle to
      the spread of content: we find evidence for a complexity barrier whereby editors are less likely to edit complex content in a second language. In addition, we find
      that multilinguals are less engaged and show lower levels of language proficiency in their second languages. We also examine the topical interests of multilingual
      editors and find that there is no significant difference between primary and non-primary editors in each language.
